# go-hse

Repository for the Higher School of Economics summer mini-course on Go programming language. 

In the hw1 folder there are implementations of 30 mini-tasks, which cover various syntax features. 

In the hw2 folder there is a project, that consists of a server and a client. The server stores bank accounts, each account has name and corresponding balance. Through requests we can manipulate this data.
